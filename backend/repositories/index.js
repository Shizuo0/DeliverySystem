/**
 * Repositories Layer
 * 
 * Repositories handle data access and persistence.
 * They abstract database operations from the business logic.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Execute database queries
 * - Map between database records and domain objects
 * - Handle database-specific operations

// Repositories will be added here as the project grows
