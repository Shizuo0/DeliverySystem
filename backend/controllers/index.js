/**
 * Controllers Layer
 * 
 * Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
 * They should be thin and delegate business logic to services.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Parse request data
 * - Call appropriate service methods
 * - Format and send responses
 * - Handle HTTP status codes
 */

// Controllers will be added here as the project grows
